# 🌍 Analysis of Fertility Rate & Life Expectancy

This project explores the dynamic relationship between fertility rates and life expectancy at birth across different countries and regions, using data from the World Bank.

## 🎯 Research Questions
1. **Correlation**: Do countries with higher life expectancies tend to have lower fertility rates?
2. **Regional Differences**: Does this relationship vary significantly across different continents?
3. **Case Study**: What are the specific trends and characteristics comparing China 🇨🇳 and France 🇫🇷 over the past few decades?

## 📊 Datasets
The analysis relies on two primary datasets sourced from the **World Bank Group**:
* `Fertility_rate.csv`: Total fertility rate (births per woman) by country and year.
* `Life_expectancy_at_birth.csv`: Life expectancy at birth (years) by country and year.

## 🛠️ Key Insights
* **Negative Correlation**: The data generally confirms that as life expectancy increases due to better healthcare, fertility rates tend to decline.
* **China's Drastic Shift**: Influenced by the "One-Child Policy" and rapid urbanization, China saw a much sharper decline in birth rates compared to many other nations.
* **France's Stability**: France maintains a more gradual decline, likely supported by robust pro-family social policies and safety nets.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure you have `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` installed.
2. Keep the `.ipynb` file and the two `.csv` files in the same directory.
3. Open the `XU_Wenting_FinalProject.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code to view the full analysis and visualizations.
